<h2>  
    
    <p>
    Acodaar is me,  as a casual Twitch Streamer.</p>
    <p>
   
  
   Since January 2021 I've been exploring the streaming Platform TWITCH. 
   
   
   As part of my investigations I became  an indiviual Streamer.
   
   I have a Twitch site under the username ACODAAR (derived from " I am a coder" and tweaked to sound exotic ) and have done streams of myself building projects with the Unity Game engine. </p>
   
   
   <img src="AC0b.jpg" alt="Acodar Site Pic">
  
  
  
   
   
   <p>ASK PHASE - -
   Two requirements.</p>
   
  <p> 1) Identify the specific problem you are trying to solve. </p>
   
   <p>I wish to identify what data sources are available to an individual streamer, </p>
   <p> what tools can be appropriate to the aquired data, and what knowledge can be gained from that analysis.
   </p>

   <p> 2) Consider key stakeholders. </p>
   <p>The key stakeholder is a single streamer with the characteristics of a few exploratory streams, but access
   to what the host, Twitch provides all registered streamers directly both in raw data and a propriatory on site analysis package.
   </p>  

   <p>  :</p>
   <img src="AC1.jpg" alt="Acodar Site Pic">
    
  <p>Main Source of Data used. </p>

   
  
   <p>For Acodaar:
   
</p>
   
  <p> The data analysis  on Twitch  with Twitch Dashboard was limited  due to my limited streams. <br>
   Data sources were non existant from the Twitch API as I do not want to register as a Third Party Twitch developer and initiate an external  website.
   <br>
   Data sources from Third Party delevoplers were non existant for  Acodaar due to them
     having a threshold of activity, usually 4 to 10 "followerers". I had not met this 
    and their tracking had not commenced.  
</p>
   <br>
   The data with Twitch download was great detail showing what data Twitch records but limited in data entries due to limited streams.
  <p>  </p>
   <img src="AC2.jpg" alt="Acodar Site Pic">
</p>
  <p> Was able to download a file in Excel format. Columns A to AK. That's 37 tracked statistics.</p>

  <img src="AC3.jpg" alt="Acodar Site Pic">
  <p> and a quick cut and paste in MS Paint to show where there is some detail.</p>
  <img src="AC4.jpg" alt="Acodar Site Pic">

   <br>
   This also gave me insight to what level of detail third party developers get from the Twitch API for active streamers.
  
  
   <p>The process phase of my analysis and  issues with : </p>
   Bias, credibility, problems with the data, verifying integrity.
   Data cleaning and manipulation. 
   
   
  <p> I imported the CSV files into a spreadsheet. Calculated all column totals. <br>
   Eliminated columns with no data and experimented with some sorts   </p>
  <p> <img src="AC5.jpg" alt="Acodar Site Pic"></p>
   
   
   
   
  <p>In the analyze phase of my analysis, I explored with Python and the numerous libraries available for anysis and ploting.
  </p>

    <p>I tried some things with numpy,  pandas, matplotlib, plotley  and seaborn. Some examples follow showing some problems
      </p>

      <p><img src="py005.png" alt="Acodar Site Pic"></p>
      <p><img src="py006.png" alt="Acodar Site Pic"></p>
     
   
   <p>I visited Tableau Public and referenced my April Acodaar data. Although my explorations were pretty I had a problem
      with the dates  listing alphabetically. So all the Fridays were bunched at the beginning. Here's some examples of my explorations.
      
      </p> 

      <p><img src="tb001.png" alt="Acodar Site Pic"></p>
      <p><img src="tb002.png" alt="Acodar Site Pic"></p>
      <p><img src="tb003.png" alt="Acodar Site Pic"></p>
      <p><img src="tb004.png" alt="Acodar Site Pic"></p>
      <p><img src="tb005.png" alt="Acodar Site Pic"></p>
      <p><img src="tb006.png" alt="Acodar Site Pic"></p>
   
   <p>I imported the Twitch file for my most active 30 days, April 2021
      into RStudio and created some data visualizations. I ensured my dataâ€™s 
      integrity and confirmed that it was clean and ready to analyze by reviewing the dates I streamed , after all, I was the source of this data.
   It was as I remember.</p>
  
   <p><img src="AC6.jpg" alt="Acodar Site Pic"></p>
  
   
   These visualizations reflected my findings, data story, and memory. I kept them clean and simple.
   
    
    <p><img src="AC8.jpg" alt="Acodar Site Pic"></p>
    <p>1.</p>
    <p><img src="AC82.jpg" alt="Acodar Site Pic"></p>
    <p>2.</p>
    <p><img src="AC83.jpg" alt="Acodar Site Pic"></p>
    <p>3.</p>



    
     <p> </p>
     <p> Conclusions:</p>
     <p> </p>
      The anlysis of the data helped confirm my decisions and orient me as to the process. 
      I had found it awkward concentrating on my work and monitering the chat. Doing neither well, I discontinued after about 2 weeks.
      Live coding is not a big draw on Twitch and now I know why. I adjusted, coding off screen and posting
      clips of my finished bits.<p>I still seach for a successful new use case using Twitch for the
       50 plus demographic, but now proceed with an insider's experience and knowlege.</p>
